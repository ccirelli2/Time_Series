# Models For Count Data _______________________________________________________

- 	So far all models have been focused on continuous variables. 
- 	Todety we are going to talk about models for when the variables are
	descrete. 
	Ex:	Binary variables. 
		Count data. 



# Count Variable ------------------------------------------------------------

Models:
-	Poisson Regression:  Most common model.  Models the count based on 
	a poisson distribution.  It cannot account for overdispersion and 
	zero-inflation. 
-	Zero-Inflation model
-	Hurdle Model


Data Types of Descrete Variables:
-	Categorical:
		variable is the most common.  Yes No is both binary and 
		categorical.  Other examples include different brand names.
		Types of animals, etc. 
-	If there are only two categories, we can use Logistic Regression. 
-	If there are more than two, we can use the Choice Model.

-	Ordinal Variable:	Can be ordered in a meaningful way. 
		Ex: the size of a teacher.  Small, medium and large. 
		Also, count data is also ordinal.  Count of times. 
		It can be any non-negative integers. 
		Models:  Ordered Choice Model


Examples of Count Data:
-	Number of insurance claims a person file per year. Always 
	happening on a fixed time period.  
-	Number of hospital admissions for a given person per year. 	
-	Number of jumps in stock returns per day.  Fixed time period is
	day.

Linear Regression:
-	We assume a normal distribution of y given x. y|x ~ N(xT B, sigma^2)
-	Link function?
-	Linear model only make sense if y is continuous because the normal dist
	is continuous. 

General Linear Model:
-	What is the conditional distribution?   
-	We generalize the linear model to extending it to a more 
	general distribution group and extend the link to 
	a more general relationship g(mu) = ni. 

Logistic Regression:
-	One type of the generalized linear model. 
-	It extends the conditional distribution y|x from normal to bernoulli. 
-	Link is through a logit function.  log(mu / (1-mu))
-	mu is equal to the expectation which is equal to P(y=0) = 1-p
-	p(y=1) = p
-	E(y) = p

Family of GLM Models

-	binomial	logit
-	gaussian 	
-	poisson




Poisson Distribution:
-	Model use for counts. 
-	Ex:  Model the number of arrivals within a given time period. 
-	Ex:	Number of phone calls per hour. 
-	P(X =k) = lambda^k * e ^ -lambda / k!
	Lambda = arrival rate.  P(X=k) is the expected value of X. 
-	As lambda increased the number of X increases. 
-	Mean and Variance of a poisson distribution is equal to lambda. 


Example Poisson Regression:
-	Cross-section data of 2,000 registered boat owners. 
-	Ask them the number of trips per boat. 
-	Also collected a number of covariates. 
-	Model conditional distribution of y|x given a poisson dist. 
-	We need to specify the link between the mu, which is the exp(eta). 
-	To answer the question about the link, lets look at the logistic regression 
	function.  
-	We take the logorithm of the mu.



Part II --------------------------------------------------------------


Review:
-	Poisson cannot handle over dispersion of data, and
-	Zero inflation. 
-	Both variance and expectation are equal to lambda. Both are the same. 
-	Only when this is a valid assumption will a poisson dist be a good model. 
-	If the level of variation or spread is higher than the mean over dispersion exists. 
-	The same applies to Poisson Regression because the assumptions are the same. 

Overdispersion:
-	We can test for overspiersion. 
-	Var(yi|xi) = (1 + alpha)mu = dispersion * mu.
-	R package AER you can conduct this analysis.  It makes the detection of overdispersion
	very simple. 
-	pass regression result to dispersiontest()
-	Check the P-value.  If small, you reject the null-hypothesis. 
-	Null alpha = 0.  Conclude that there is enough evidence to support that alpha
	is greater than zero. 
-	Function also outputs the dispersion factor.  If result = 7, then variance is
	7x greater than mean. 

Model For Over Dispersion - Negative Binomial Distribution
-	f(y: mu, theta): theta controls the over dispersion. 
-	Poisson is just a special case where theta equals zero. 
-	eta symbol.  need to look this up and how to fit it.
-	Also look up "link functions". 


Zero Inflation:
-	Look at histogram. 
-	In the presentation, the count for 0 is significantly hire than you would
	expect to find in a poisson distributon.  
-	Zero Inflation Model (ZAM):  Mixture distribution, try to model the 0's and 1's
	seperately. 
-	R function is zeroinfl(trips ~ . | quality + income, data=, dist='')

Hurdle Model:
-	How do we determine if the value is 0 or 1?
-	Part II of Zero inflation model assumes that there is a probability that 
	the answer could be 0.  Hurdle model has a complete distinction and in part II
	there is no probability of 0. 
-	Hurdle model is used more frequently. 

Model Check:
-	Check actual counts versus predicted charts and get percentages correct.
