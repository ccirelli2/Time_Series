## MA smoother
'mar:   c(bottom, left, top, right) which specify the margins on each side of the plot
 mfrow: number of rows
 reP:   replicate eliements of a vector
 Filter:  reference = https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/lesson/5/5.2
          The term filter is sometimes used to describe a smoothing procedure. For instance, 
          if the smoothed value for a particular time is calculated as a linear combination of observations 
          for surrounding times, it might be said that weâ€™ve applied a linear filter to the data 
          (not the same as saying the result is a straight line, by the way).
          filter(series, sides= either one side or two, filter = wieghts to use)
          so I guess we can make an arbitrary filter that is applied to one or both sides of the target value in the time series. 
          see documentation at online.stat

par(mfrow=c(1,1),mar=c(4,4,2,2))
wgts = c(.5,rep(1,11),.5)/12  # filter of length 13 applied to both sides of series
soif = filter(soi,sides=2,filter=wgts)

## kernel smoother
' Kernel Regression Smoother - ksmooth
  Note:  This looks like the smooth technique that is used with fitting a regression line
  time:  creates the vector of times at which a time series was sampled
'
