Difference between AR and MA Models?
- 	The primary difference is based on the correlation between time series
	objects and different time points. 
- 	The correlation between x(t) and x(t-n) for n>1 order of MA is always
	zero.  This directly flows from the fact that covariance between x(t) and 
	x(t-n) is zero for MA models. 
- 	On the other hand, with AR models, the covariance beteen x(t) and x(t-n)
	slowly declines as n gets bigger. 
- 	MA model depends on the errors(residuals) of the previous forecasts you made
	to make the current forecasts. 
	AR depends on lagged values of the data you are modeling to make forecasts. 


What is an ACF Plot?
- 	Plot of the total correlation between different lag functions. 
	For instance, the correlation between x(t) with x(t-1), and x(t) with x(t-2).

Determining if AR or MA Process?
- 	In a moving average series, we will not get any correlation between 
	x(t) and x(t-1). Hence, the the total correlation cuts off at nth lag. 
- 	In an AR series, the correlation between x(t) and x(t-n) will gradually 
	decrease as n increases. 
- 	Therefore, a sharp cutoff in the ACF plot indicates an MA model and a 
	gradual decrease indicates an AR model.
