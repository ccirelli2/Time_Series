1.) 	Consider signal plus noise model of general form xt = st + wt, where wt is Gaussian white
	noise with var=1. Simulate a plot of n= 200 observations from each of the following
	two models. 

	st	= signal at time t
	wt	= white-noise at time t.  I would assume we could use random sampling of
		  a gaussian dist to obtain wt. 

	a. xt = st + wt for t= 1...200, where
		st = 0 when t = 1...100
		   = some formula for t = 100...200	
		
		this seems pretty simple.  Lets create 200 white noise observations from 
		a gaussian distr.  Then for st, it will be 0 for the first 100 observations. 
		then we create the other 200 by just using the formula given. 

	b.  Its the exact same process, just that the denominator in the equation for st 
	    has changed. 

	c. Compare the general appearance of the series (a), and (b) with the earth-quake
	   series and the explosion series.



2.) 	Consider a process consisting of a linear trend with an additive noise term of independent
	random variables wt with zero mean and var sigma squared
	
	xt = B0 + Bt + wt

	Note this is just the equation of a line with the error term equal to white-noise
	at time t. 

	a.) show that xt is nonstationary (note:  can calculate mean and covar)
		question:  Isnt the test to use the mean and cov?  so why question b?  
		Maybe just plot it?
	b.) show that the difference series xt = xt = xt-1 is stationary by finding its
	    mean and autocovaraince.
	c.) I guess just repeat b with a stationary value, ty


3.) 	she's just asking us to use log to remove trend. calculate the smaple ACF and comment. 


4.) 	determine the autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of lag h= s-t
	note:  are we supposed to write the functions?
	draw the ACG as a function of h (probably just means plot)
