Difference in differences



Slide 3:  Basketball + / - values
- 	Compare performance of the team when the player
	is on and off the court. 
-	If the difference is large, i.e. a large positive number. 
-	Is this a good measurement?  We need to account for other
	factors that may account for the score.  Ex: other opponents. 
- 	If it is a home game or not. 
-	Forming a regression setting, but with limitations due to
	these other factors. 
-	Purpose:  This is the example of the "ommitted variable setting". 


Slide 4:	Evaluate Airbnb New Feature
- 	Dl algorithm to improve photo's quality. 
- 	Airbnb wants to evaluate the effect of the new model. 
- 	Regress earnings onto a bunch of variables associated with the 
 	property.  Use B3 to measure the effect of the program.  
	So one of your variables and coefficients to measure effect. 
- 	There are some flaws as we are not controlling for the original
	photo quality.  Also, who decided to use the new photos versus old. 
- 	Study is not random as people choose which feature they do and don't use. 


Slide 5: 	Estimation Bias
-	Unbiased:	Means that the E(B1) should = or be close to B1
-	Consisten:	Weaker threshold that the expectation of B1 will approach
	actual B1 over a large dataset. 

Slide 6: 	Estimation Bias
-	I want to make sure there is no correlation between my 
	X and error terms.  
-	Probably one of the ommitted variables it the quality of the original 
	photo, so that is part of my error term. 
-	If X and error term are correlated, we are not good as there will be 
	some effect of the error term on X. 
-	Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator

Slide 7:	Sources of Estimation Bias
-	Ommitted Variable Bias:  if ommitted variable is correlated with X. 
-	Missing data and sample selection bias:  Not having a good source
	of information.  So for example, you go to a single hospital 
	and gather data, but its not random, its just from one hospital and
	the people that elected to go to the hospital. 
-	Measurement error:	Comes up in survey data.  Some people reply and
	some don't.  The people that reply may be different from those that
	didn't.  Also error in that the responders are filling in survey, you are 
	not their personally recording the responses.   
-	Simultaneous Causality bias:  In regression, X has an effect on Y, but
	Y may also affect X.  Supply and demand is a great example.  
	Supply and demand can be one directional, but maybe demand also
	effects supply. 

Slide 8:	Ommitted Variable Problem
-	Regression setting.  
-	c:	unobservable random variable.  sometimes due to lack of
	measurement.  If c is uncorrelated with X, then we just add
	c to our error term.  If, however, it is correlated with any
	of the X, we will have a biased estimator. 

Slide 9:	Remedies
-	Fixed effect and random effect models. 
-	Randomized control experiment:	not easy to do and costly. 
-	Instrumental Variables:	

Slide 10:	Panel Data & Cross Sectional vs Panel Data
-	Cross Sectional Data:  Many different observations observed
		at a specific time point.  Use N to denote the sample size. 
		Ex: Survey data is cross sectional.  Ex GDP, populateion, rate of 
		unemployemnt, end of 2018.  
		Ex:  Closing prices of 20 different tech stocks on Dec 3rd, 2018. 
-	Panel Data:  Usually referred to as longitudinal data.  We have
		observations as multiple time points. 
		Ex:  So for the same 20 stocks we have observations for 3 days. 
-	Time Series:	One stock over a time series. You follow a single 
		subject and you follow that over time. 
-	Panel data is different as the time period is small and you have 
		more than one variable. This is the difference between time series
		and panel data.  Panel data you want your number of subjects to be 
		large and the time period to be small. 

Slide 12:	Panel Data & Ommitted Variable Problem
-	Ommitted Variables:	Great example is thinking about things that you
		can and can't measure.  So what if we are trying to predict 
		salary.  Well, we can measure education, gender, years of exp, etc.
		What we likely can't measure are thinking like talent, personality, 
		beauty, etc.  These latter variables may influence the salary, but
		we can't measure them accuratly.  
		This is what is meant by the variable c.  It is considered constant
		over time. 
-	C:	Characteristic about me, and will be constant at all time periods. 
		Key assumption of the model. 
		yt = XtB + c + ut, t = 1,2,..
-	Two Scenarios:
		c is uncorrelated with any of the x's. Use ordinary least squared. 
		c is correlated with x's.  If you just run OLS your prediction
		will be inconsistent.  You need to eliminate the effect of c. 
		How?	Take the difference of the two equations and c will 
				be cancelled.  
		Second model is called "fixed effect model"
		First model is random effect model. 

Slide 14	Unobserved Effect Model (UEM)
- 	Summary of what we have learned so far. c we always refer to it as the
	unobserved variable or heterogeneity. 
	It is also called individual effect. 
-	How to decide if c and x are correlated?  cov(xit, ci)

Slide 16	Model 
-	Test:  effect of job training on subsequent wages. 
-	Treatment and control situation. 
-	Questions:  Are the employees randomly selected?  If they are randomly
		selected we do not have an estimation bias.  So we don't need to
		worry about the unique characteristics of the employee?
-	Second scenario: 	we only send the best performing employees to the 
		program.  Now you have selection bias.  
-	Now, do we think that this variable is correlated with X. What can be the
		ci here for this scenario?  Ex: past performance.  Is this correlated?
		yes, because in fact this is how they are being selected. 

Slide 19:	Random Effect Model
-	Allows you to utlize the c term to improve model. 
-	Estimate covariance of error term, which is the actual error term
	and the hidden characteristic of that subject. 
-	What is the structure of the omega matrix?
	It will be a two by two matrix.  First element cov vi and itself or var(vi)
	On the diagonal you will have the variance of the two terms. 
	On the off diagonal you will have the variance of only c.
-	In practice how can you estimate the variance?
	Run linear regression, get error term and calculate variance. 
	sigma c^2?  How can you estimate.  Calculate the
	correlation between the error term from time period 1 and time
	period 2. 
-	Estimating these values and constructing the correlation matrix helps
	us to understand the structure of the error term. 
-	Forumula for generalized least squared adds weights to X and Y to accomodate
	for the correlation between c and x.  It is called random effect model. 
-	Must have full rank in order to take inverse. 

*Slide 24: Test Dependence
-	If sigma c^2 is equal to zero there is not correlation between 
	vi1 and vi2.  This tells us that the c does not vary.  If c is always
	constant then it is not important. 


Slide 26:	Fixed Effect Model
-	X and c can be correlated.
-	Requires less assumptions. 
-	Only that X and the error terms are uncorrelated.


Slide 27:	Between equation
-	Why are we calculating the between and within equations?
